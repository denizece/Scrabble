Hi,
The application runs on 8083 currently.
When ScrabbleApplication is run as java application mongodb is configured
The swagger can be accessed by http://localhost:8083/swagger-ui/index.html
Test can be done there.
I would have liked to implement a simple frontend for ease of testing, and junit tests in addition.
